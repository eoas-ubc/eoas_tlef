    "but is provided through one of several possible library modules. The\n",

    "Because MatPlotLib is an external library---in fact it's a collection of\n",
    "libraries---it must be imported into any routine that uses it.\n",
    "MatPlotLib makes extensive use of NumPy so the two should be imported\n",

    "a title and a legend, and control the color of symbols and lines. All of\n",
    "this is possible but requires calling a number of plotting functions.\n",

    "just draw point---or dots---at each data point, or we can instruct it to\n",
    "draw straight lines between the data points. To create the illusion of\n",
    "the smooth function that the sine function is, we need to create enough\n",
    "$(x,y)$ data points so that when `plot` draws straight lines between the\n",
    "data points, the function appears to be smooth. The sine function\n",
    "undergoes two full oscillations with two maxima and two minima between 0\n",
    "and $4\\pi$. So let's start by creating an array with 33 data points\n",
    "between 0 and $4\\pi$, and then let MatPlotLib draw a straight line\n",
    "between them. Our code consists of four parts\n",

    "One problem, however, is that while the plot oscillates like a sine\n",

    "\n",
    "When plotting experimental data it is customary to include error bars\n",
    "that indicate graphically the degree of uncertainty that exists in the\n",

    "When error bars are desired, you typically replace the `plot` function\n",

    "`plot` function. The keyword `fmt` *must be used* to specify the format\n",
    "of the points to be plotted; the format specifiers are the same as for\n",
    "`plot`. The keywords `xerr` and `yerr` are used to specify the $x$ and\n",
    "$y$ error bars. Setting one or both of them to a constant specifies one\n",
    "size for all the error bars. Alternatively, setting one or both of them\n",
    "equal to an array that has the same length as the `x` and `y` arrays\n",
    "allows you to give each data point an error bar with a different value.\n",
    "If you only want $y$ error bars, then you should only specify the `yerr`\n",

    "of 0.75, meaning that the error bars extend 0.75 to the left and 0.75 to\n",
    "the right of each data point. The $y$ error bars are set equal to an\n",
