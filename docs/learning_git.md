# Learning Git

Git and GitHub; commandline use and from within VS-Code, possibly GitHub destop. Note that individuals' choices for IDE or working environment will be personal.
  - The [pull request workflow](https://github.com/eoas-ubc/eoas_tlef/blob/master/docs/Git_workflow.md). See also document [Git_workflow.md](Git_workflow.md).
  - Downloadable book: [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
  - Ch 3.6, [Git Branching - Rebasing](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing) covers the "Open source pull request workflow", and that chapter is discussed in this [16 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRlGDDprdOQ).
  - Same author has four short videos [here](https://git-scm.com/videos) although I've not seen them.
  - 1hr intro [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc), although some parts are less necessary for rank beginners (such as the "ignore" file).
  - Linkedin Learning course, free for UBC faculty & staff (not students), at [Git Branches, Merges and remotes](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/git-branches-merges-and-remotes/). Quite comprehensive, but sheds light on what's going on. (Find it via [UBC's LinkedIn Learning login page](https://linkedinlearning.ubc.ca/?login).)
