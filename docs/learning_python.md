# Learning Python

If a separate learning facility is to be produced, it should be in a Jupyter Notebook, and it shoudl be adapted from parts of the following sources.

- [Pyman](http://phaustin.github.io/pyman/index.html), a Scientific Python Tutorial.
- Phil's [numerical methods course](https://phaustin.github.io/numeric/index.html).
- MATLAB vs Python: [why and how to make the switch](https://realpython.com/matlab-vs-python/) very good although advertisment supported (dated Sept 2019). Also points to further resources. 
  - Webinar (Sept 2017, 48min) "_Python for MatLab users, what you need to know_": [on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkCegjtoHFQ). Start at 7:35 mins, & ignore references to "Canopy", a depricated IDE.
  - Their corresponding 52-pg white paper [PDF](https://www.enthought.com/wp-content/uploads/Enthought-MATLAB-to-Python-White-Paper.pdf).
- Some more [recommended python learning resources](https://forums.fast.ai/t/recommended-python-learning-resources/26888).
- Computational physics, by Mark Newman [sample chapters](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cp/chapters.html). OK but a bit "wordy" (i.e. long).
  - Ch2: Python programming for physicists;
  - Ch3: Graphics and visualization;
  - Ch4: Accuracy and speed;
  - Ch5: Integrals and derivatives.
- Recommended resources from J. Howard at [fast.ai](https://forums.fast.ai/t/recommended-python-learning-resources/26888).
