# Working on the TLEF project

Priorities for bringing new colleagues on board, including other developers or instructors.

Even if new contributors are up to speed with one or more of these techniques, checking this sequence should ensure clarity during "onboarding".

## Be able to

These capabilities are best checked and learned in the order shown because they increase in both complexity and dependancy with outside resources or people.

- Be able to install and run Jupyter Notebook on your local computer. (_Ref to instructions_).
- Manage "environments" from the command line.
  - *Needs some background.*
- Choose and practice using a text editor. VS-Code recommended if there is not already a favorite. Capabilities and integration with workflow, Git and other IDE aspects can be learned as projects progress.
- Write and run Python code within Jupyter notebooks. 
  - *How to define "minimum" familiarity with Python versus MatLab? How to check on that level of familiarity?*
- Add Jupytext to Python environment and check it causes a save to update both the `.ipynb` and `.md` files together.
- Make a book using Jupyter Book (*command line only?*). Gain preliminary familiarity with all the parts (files) of a "book".
- Add to the "practice" Jupyter book to make use of equations, numbering, referencing and other features. 
- Gain familiarity with  version control for your OWN projects using Git and GitHub.
  - Working entirely within VS-Code is possible and convenient, although familiarity with the command line is probably an "essential skill".
  - (*Need a sandbox exercise to walk through the steps.*)
  - Work up to collaborating with others using the pull request workflow. See local document [Git_workflow.md](Git_workflow.md).
- Convert `.docx`, `.pptx` and `.tex` files to markdown. (This may end up a temporary step towards converting presentations, demonstrations, assignments in-class worksheets into Notebooks or other markdown-based materials.)
- Generate quizzes for import to UBC's Canvas Learning Management System. (Not yet accomplished as of June 2020).

## Tools & references

Note there will be separate pages for numbered items here. This list points to some selected _outside_ references. These choices may change as better options are found.

1. Git and GitHub; commandline use and from within VS-Code, possibly GitHub destop. Individual choices for IDE or working environment may vary.
    - Local document [learning_git.md](learning_git.md).
    - Local document [Git_workflow.md](Git_workflow.md).
2. Text editors: 
    - VS Code or Atom? See [comparison here](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/visual-studio-code-vs-atom/). 
    - Using VS-Code in a separate document [vscode_howto.md](vscode_howto.md).
3. Python via local document [learning_python.md](learning_python.md).
4. Jupyter notebooks via _Anaconda_, and _miniconda3_. 
5. Making books with Jupyter and Jupytext [via local document](learning_books&jupytext.md).
