# OOP II: Building Classes

## Overview

In an {ref}`earlier lecture <oop_intro>`, we
learned some foundations of object-oriented programming.

The objectives of this lecture are

-   cover OOP in more depth
-   learn how to build our own objects, specialized to our needs

For example, you already know how to

-   create lists, strings and other Python objects
-   use their methods to modify their contents

So imagine now you want to write a program with consumers, who can

-   hold and spend cash
-   consume goods
-   work and earn cash

A natural solution in Python would be to create consumers as objects
with

-   data, such as cash on hand
-   methods, such as `buy` or `work` that affect this data

Python makes it easy to do this, by providing you with **class
definitions**.

Classes are blueprints that help you build objects according to your own
specifications.

It takes a little while to get used to the syntax so we\'ll provide
plenty of examples.

We\'ll use the following imports:

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
```

## OOP Review

OOP is supported in many languages:

-   JAVA and Ruby are relatively pure OOP.
-   Python supports both procedural and object-oriented programming.
-   Fortran and MATLAB are mainly procedural, some OOP recently tacked
    on.
-   C is a procedural language, while C++ is C with OOP added on top.

Let\'s cover general OOP concepts before we specialize to Python.

### Key Concepts

As discussed an {ref}`earlier lecture <oop_intro>`, in the OOP paradigm, data and functions are **bundled
together** into \"objects\".

An example is a Python list, which not only stores data but also knows
how to sort itself, etc.

```{code-cell} ipython3
x = [1, 5, 4]
x.sort()
x
```

As we now know, `sort` is a function that is \"part of\" the list object
--- and hence called a *method*.

If we want to make our own types of objects we need to use class
definitions.

A *class definition* is a blueprint for a particular class of objects
(e.g., lists, strings or complex numbers).

It describes

-   What kind of data the class stores
-   What methods it has for acting on these data

An *object* or *instance* is a realization of the class, created from
the blueprint

-   Each instance has its own unique data.
-   Methods set out in the class definition act on this (and other)
    data.

In Python, the data and methods of an object are collectively referred
to as *attributes*.

Attributes are accessed via \"dotted attribute notation\"

-   `object_name.data`
-   `object_name.method_name()`

In the example

```{code-cell} ipython3
x = [1, 5, 4]
x.sort()
x.__class__
```

-   `x` is an object or instance, created from the definition for Python
    lists, but with its own particular data.
-   `x.sort()` and `x.__class__` are two attributes of `x`.
-   `dir(x)` can be used to view all the attributes of `x`.

(why_oop)=

### Why is OOP Useful?

OOP is useful for the same reason that abstraction is useful: for
recognizing and exploiting the common structure.

For example,

-   *a Markov chain* consists of a set of states and a collection of
    transition probabilities for moving across states
-   *a general equilibrium theory* consists of a commodity space,
    preferences, technologies, and an equilibrium definition
-   *a game* consists of a list of players, lists of actions available
    to each player, player payoffs as functions of all players\'
    actions, and a timing protocol

These are all abstractions that collect together \"objects\" of the same
\"type\".

Recognizing common structure allows us to employ common tools.

In economic theory, this might be a proposition that applies to all
games of a certain type.

In Python, this might be a method that\'s useful for all Markov chains
(e.g., `simulate`).

When we use OOP, the `simulate` method is conveniently bundled together
with the Markov chain object.

## Defining Your Own Classes

Let\'s build some simple classes to start off.

(oop_consumer_class)=

### Example: A Consumer Class

First, we\'ll build a `Consumer` class with

-   a `wealth` attribute that stores the consumer\'s wealth (data)
-   an `earn` method, where `earn(y)` increments the consumer\'s wealth
    by `y`
-   a `spend` method, where `spend(x)` either decreases wealth by `x` or
    returns an error if insufficient funds exist

Admittedly a little contrived, this example of a class helps us
internalize some new syntax.

Here\'s one implementation

```{code-cell} ipython3
class Consumer:

    def __init__(self, w):
        "Initialize consumer with w dollars of wealth"
        self.wealth = w

    def earn(self, y):
        "The consumer earns y dollars"
        self.wealth += y

    def spend(self, x):
        "The consumer spends x dollars if feasible"
        new_wealth = self.wealth - x
        if new_wealth < 0:
            print("Insufficent funds")
        else:
            self.wealth = new_wealth
```

There\'s some special syntax here so let\'s step through carefully

-   The `class` keyword indicates that we are building a class.

This class defines instance data `wealth` and three methods: `__init__`,
`earn` and `spend`

-   `wealth` is *instance data* because each consumer we create (each
    instance of the `Consumer` class) will have its own separate wealth
    data.

The ideas behind the `earn` and `spend` methods were discussed above.

Both of these act on the instance data `wealth`.

The `__init__` method is a *constructor method*.

Whenever we create an instance of the class, this method will be called
automatically.

Calling `__init__` sets up a \"namespace\" to hold the instance data
--- more on this soon.

We\'ll also discuss the role of `self` just below.

#### Usage

Here\'s an example of usage

```{code-cell} ipython3
c1 = Consumer(10)  # Create instance with initial wealth 10
c1.spend(5)
c1.wealth
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
c1.earn(15)
c1.spend(100)
```

We can of course create multiple instances each with its own data

```{code-cell} ipython3
c1 = Consumer(10)
c2 = Consumer(12)
c2.spend(4)
c2.wealth
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
c1.wealth
```

In fact, each instance stores its data in a separate namespace
dictionary

```{code-cell} ipython3
c1.__dict__
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
c2.__dict__
```

When we access or set attributes we\'re actually just modifying the
dictionary maintained by the instance.

#### Self

If you look at the `Consumer` class definition again you\'ll see the
word `self` throughout the code.

The rules with `self` are that

-   Any instance data should be prepended with `self`
    -   e.g., the `earn` method references `self.wealth` rather than just `wealth`
-   Any method defined within the class should have `self` as its first
    argument
    -   e.g., `def earn(self, y)` rather than just `def earn(y)`
-   Any method referenced within the class should be called as
    `self.method_name`

There are no examples of the last rule in the preceding code but we will
see some shortly.

#### Details

In this section, we look at some more formal details related to classes
and `self`

-   You might wish to skip to
    `the next section <oop_solow_growth>`
    on first pass of this lecture.
-   You can return to these details after you\'ve familiarized yourself
    with more examples.

Methods actually live inside a class object formed when the interpreter
reads the class definition

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(Consumer.__dict__)  # Show __dict__ attribute of class object
```

Note how the three methods `__init__`, `earn` and `spend` are stored in
the class object.

Consider the following code

```{code-cell} ipython3
c1 = Consumer(10)
c1.earn(10)
c1.wealth
```

When you call `earn` via `c1.earn(10)` the interpreter passes the
instance `c1` and the argument `10` to `Consumer.earn`.

In fact, the following are equivalent

-   `c1.earn(10)`
-   `Consumer.earn(c1, 10)`

In the function call `Consumer.earn(c1, 10)` note that `c1` is the first
argument.

Recall that in the definition of the `earn` method, `self` is the first
parameter

```{code-cell} ipython3
def earn(self, y):
     "The consumer earns y dollars"
     self.wealth += y
```

The end result is that `self` is bound to the instance `c1` inside the
function call.

That\'s why the statement `self.wealth += y` inside `earn` ends up
modifying `c1.wealth`.

(oop_solow_growth)=

### Example: The Solow Growth Model

For our next example, let\'s write a simple class to implement the Solow
growth model.

The Solow growth model is a neoclassical growth model where the amount
of capital stock per capita $k_t$ evolves according to the rule

```{math}
---
label: solow_lom
---
k_{t+1} = \frac{s z k_t^{\alpha} + (1 - \delta) k_t}{1 + n}
```

Here

-   $s$ is an exogenously given savings rate
-   $z$ is a productivity parameter
-   $\alpha$ is capital\'s share of income
-   $n$ is the population growth rate
-   $\delta$ is the depreciation rate

The **steady state** of the model is the $k$ that solves
{math:numref}`solow_lom` when $k_{t+1} = k_t = k$.

Here\'s a class that implements this model.

Some points of interest in the code are

-   An instance maintains a record of its current capital stock in the
    variable `self.k`.
-   The `h` method implements the right-hand side of
    {math:numref}`solow_lom`.
-   The `update` method uses `h` to update capital as per
    {math:numref}`solow_lom`.

    > -   Notice how inside `update` the reference to the local method
    >     `h` is `self.h`.

The methods `steady_state` and `generate_sequence` are fairly
self-explanatory

```{code-cell} ipython3
class Solow:
    r"""
    Implements the Solow growth model with the update rule

        k_{t+1} = [(s z k^α_t) + (1 - δ)k_t] /(1 + n)

    """
    def __init__(self, n=0.05,  # population growth rate
                       s=0.25,  # savings rate
                       δ=0.1,   # depreciation rate
                       α=0.3,   # share of labor
                       z=2.0,   # productivity
                       k=1.0):  # current capital stock

        self.n, self.s, self.δ, self.α, self.z = n, s, δ, α, z
        self.k = k

    def h(self):
        "Evaluate the h function"
        # Unpack parameters (get rid of self to simplify notation)
        n, s, δ, α, z = self.n, self.s, self.δ, self.α, self.z
        # Apply the update rule
        return (s * z * self.k**α + (1 - δ) * self.k) / (1 + n)

    def update(self):
        "Update the current state (i.e., the capital stock)."
        self.k =  self.h()

    def steady_state(self):
        "Compute the steady state value of capital."
        # Unpack parameters (get rid of self to simplify notation)
        n, s, δ, α, z = self.n, self.s, self.δ, self.α, self.z
        # Compute and return steady state
        return ((s * z) / (n + δ))**(1 / (1 - α))

    def generate_sequence(self, t):
        "Generate and return a time series of length t"
        path = []
        for i in range(t):
            path.append(self.k)
            self.update()
        return path
```

Here\'s a little program that uses the class to compute time series from
two different initial conditions.

The common steady state is also plotted for comparison

```{code-cell} ipython3
s1 = Solow()
s2 = Solow(k=8.0)

T = 60
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Plot the common steady state value of capital
ax.plot([s1.steady_state()]*T, 'k-', label='steady state')

# Plot time series for each economy
for s in s1, s2:
    lb = f'capital series from initial state {s.k}'
    ax.plot(s.generate_sequence(T), 'o-', lw=2, alpha=0.6, label=lb)

ax.set_xlabel('$k_{t+1}$', fontsize=14)
ax.set_ylabel('$k_t$', fontsize=14)
ax.legend()
plt.show()
```

### Example: A Market

Next, let\'s write a class for a simple one good market where agents are
price takers.

The market consists of the following objects:

-   A linear demand curve $Q = a_d - b_d p$
-   A linear supply curve $Q = a_z + b_z (p - t)$

Here

-   $p$ is price paid by the consumer, $Q$ is quantity and $t$ is a
    per-unit tax.
-   Other symbols are demand and supply parameters.

The class provides methods to compute various values of interest,
including competitive equilibrium price and quantity, tax revenue
raised, consumer surplus and producer surplus.

Here\'s our implementation.

(It uses a function from SciPy called `quad` for numerical
integration---a topic we will say more about later on.)

```{code-cell} ipython3
from scipy.integrate import quad

class Market:

    def __init__(self, ad, bd, az, bz, tax):
        """
        Set up market parameters.  All parameters are scalars.  See
        https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/python_oop.html for interpretation.

        """
        self.ad, self.bd, self.az, self.bz, self.tax = ad, bd, az, bz, tax
        if ad < az:
            raise ValueError('Insufficient demand.')

    def price(self):
        "Return equilibrium price"
        return  (self.ad - self.az + self.bz * self.tax) / (self.bd + self.bz)

    def quantity(self):
        "Compute equilibrium quantity"
        return  self.ad - self.bd * self.price()

    def consumer_surp(self):
        "Compute consumer surplus"
        # == Compute area under inverse demand function == #
        integrand = lambda x: (self.ad / self.bd) - (1 / self.bd) * x
        area, error = quad(integrand, 0, self.quantity())
        return area - self.price() * self.quantity()

    def producer_surp(self):
        "Compute producer surplus"
        #  == Compute area above inverse supply curve, excluding tax == #
        integrand = lambda x: -(self.az / self.bz) + (1 / self.bz) * x
        area, error = quad(integrand, 0, self.quantity())
        return (self.price() - self.tax) * self.quantity() - area

    def taxrev(self):
        "Compute tax revenue"
        return self.tax * self.quantity()

    def inverse_demand(self, x):
        "Compute inverse demand"
        return self.ad / self.bd - (1 / self.bd)* x

    def inverse_supply(self, x):
        "Compute inverse supply curve"
        return -(self.az / self.bz) + (1 / self.bz) * x + self.tax

    def inverse_supply_no_tax(self, x):
        "Compute inverse supply curve without tax"
        return -(self.az / self.bz) + (1 / self.bz) * x
```

Here\'s a sample of usage

```{code-cell} ipython3
baseline_params = 15, .5, -2, .5, 3
m = Market(*baseline_params)
print("equilibrium price = ", m.price())
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
print("consumer surplus = ", m.consumer_surp())
```

Here\'s a short program that uses this class to plot an inverse demand
curve together with inverse supply curves with and without taxes

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Baseline ad, bd, az, bz, tax
baseline_params = 15, .5, -2, .5, 3
m = Market(*baseline_params)

q_max = m.quantity() * 2
q_grid = np.linspace(0.0, q_max, 100)
pd = m.inverse_demand(q_grid)
ps = m.inverse_supply(q_grid)
psno = m.inverse_supply_no_tax(q_grid)

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(q_grid, pd, lw=2, alpha=0.6, label='demand')
ax.plot(q_grid, ps, lw=2, alpha=0.6, label='supply')
ax.plot(q_grid, psno, '--k', lw=2, alpha=0.6, label='supply without tax')
ax.set_xlabel('quantity', fontsize=14)
ax.set_xlim(0, q_max)
ax.set_ylabel('price', fontsize=14)
ax.legend(loc='lower right', frameon=False, fontsize=14)
plt.show()
```

The next program provides a function that

-   takes an instance of `Market` as a parameter
-   computes dead weight loss from the imposition of the tax

```{code-cell} ipython3
def deadw(m):
    "Computes deadweight loss for market m."
    # == Create analogous market with no tax == #
    m_no_tax = Market(m.ad, m.bd, m.az, m.bz, 0)
    # == Compare surplus, return difference == #
    surp1 = m_no_tax.consumer_surp() + m_no_tax.producer_surp()
    surp2 = m.consumer_surp() + m.producer_surp() + m.taxrev()
    return surp1 - surp2
```

Here\'s an example of usage

```{code-cell} ipython3
baseline_params = 15, .5, -2, .5, 3
m = Market(*baseline_params)
deadw(m)  # Show deadweight loss
```

### Example: Chaos

Let\'s look at one more example, related to chaotic dynamics in
nonlinear systems.

One simple transition rule that can generate complex dynamics is the
logistic map

```{math}
---
label: quadmap2
---

x_{t+1} = r x_t(1 - x_t) ,
\quad x_0 \in [0, 1],
\quad r \in [0, 4]
```

Let\'s write a class for generating time series from this model.

Here\'s one implementation

```{code-cell} ipython3
class Chaos:
  """
  Models the dynamical system with :math:`x_{t+1} = r x_t (1 - x_t)`
  """
  def __init__(self, x0, r):
      """
      Initialize with state x0 and parameter r
      """
      self.x, self.r = x0, r

  def update(self):
      "Apply the map to update state."
      self.x =  self.r * self.x *(1 - self.x)

  def generate_sequence(self, n):
      "Generate and return a sequence of length n."
      path = []
      for i in range(n):
          path.append(self.x)
          self.update()
      return path
```

Here\'s an example of usage

```{code-cell} ipython3
ch = Chaos(0.1, 4.0)     # x0 = 0.1 and r = 0.4
ch.generate_sequence(5)  # First 5 iterates
```

This piece of code plots a longer trajectory

```{code-cell} ipython3
ch = Chaos(0.1, 4.0)
ts_length = 250

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.set_xlabel('$t$', fontsize=14)
ax.set_ylabel('$x_t$', fontsize=14)
x = ch.generate_sequence(ts_length)
ax.plot(range(ts_length), x, 'bo-', alpha=0.5, lw=2, label='$x_t$')
plt.show()
```

The next piece of code provides a bifurcation diagram

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ch = Chaos(0.1, 4)
r = 2.5
while r < 4:
    ch.r = r
    t = ch.generate_sequence(1000)[950:]
    ax.plot([r] * len(t), t, 'b.', ms=0.6)
    r = r + 0.005

ax.set_xlabel('$r$', fontsize=16)
ax.set_ylabel('$x_t$', fontsize=16)
plt.show()
```

On the horizontal axis is the parameter $r$ in
{math:numref}`quadmap2`.

The vertical axis is the state space $[0, 1]$.

For each $r$ we compute a long time series and then plot the tail (the
last 50 points).

The tail of the sequence shows us where the trajectory concentrates
after settling down to some kind of steady state, if a steady state
exists.

Whether it settles down, and the character of the steady state to which
it does settle down, depend on the value of $r$.

For $r$ between about 2.5 and 3, the time series settles into a single
fixed point plotted on the vertical axis.

For $r$ between about 3 and 3.45, the time series settles down to
oscillating between the two values plotted on the vertical axis.

For $r$ a little bit higher than 3.45, the time series settles down to
oscillating among the four values plotted on the vertical axis.

Notice that there is no value of $r$ that leads to a steady state
oscillating among three values.

## Special Methods

Python provides special methods with which some neat tricks can be
performed.

For example, recall that lists and tuples have a notion of length and
that this length can be queried via the `len` function

```{code-cell} ipython3
x = (10, 20)
len(x)
```

If you want to provide a return value for the `len` function when
applied to your user-defined object, use the `__len__` special method

```{code-cell} ipython3
class Foo:

    def __len__(self):
        return 42
```

Now we get

```{code-cell} ipython3
f = Foo()
len(f)
```

(call_method)=

A special method we will use regularly is the `__call__` method.

This method can be used to make your instances callable, just like
functions

```{code-cell} ipython3
class Foo:

    def __call__(self, x):
        return x + 42
```

After running we get

```{code-cell} ipython3
f = Foo()
f(8)  # Exactly equivalent to f.__call__(8)
```

Exercise 1 provides a more useful example.

## Exercises

(oop_ex1)=

### Exercise 1

The [empirical cumulative distribution function
(ecdf)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_distribution_function)
corresponding to a sample $\{X_i\}_{i=1}^n$ is defined as

```{math}
---
label: emdist
---

F_n(x) := \frac{1}{n}  \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{1}\{X_i \leq x\}
  \qquad (x \in \mathbb{R})
```

Here $\mathbf{1}\{X_i \leq x\}$ is an indicator function (one if
$X_i \leq x$ and zero otherwise) and hence $F_n(x)$ is the fraction of
the sample that falls below $x$.

The Glivenko--Cantelli Theorem states that, provided that the sample is
IID, the ecdf $F_n$ converges to the true distribution function $F$.

Implement $F_n$ as a class called `ECDF`, where

-   A given sample $\{X_i\}_{i=1}^n$ are the instance data, stored as
    `self.observations`.
-   The class implements a `__call__` method that returns $F_n(x)$ for
    any $x$.

Your code should work as follows (modulo randomness)

```python
from random import uniform

samples = [uniform(0, 1) for i in range(10)]
F = ECDF(samples)
F(0.5)  # Evaluate ecdf at x = 0.5
```

```python
F.observations = [uniform(0, 1) for i in range(1000)]
F(0.5)
```

Aim for clarity, not efficiency.

(oop_ex2)=

### Exercise 2

In an {ref}`earlier exercise <pyess_ex2>`, you
wrote a function for evaluating polynomials.

This exercise is an extension, where the task is to build a simple class
called `Polynomial` for representing and manipulating polynomial
functions such as

```{math}
---
label: polynom
---

p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \cdots a_N x^N = \sum_{n=0}^N a_n x^n
    \qquad (x \in \mathbb{R})
```

The instance data for the class `Polynomial` will be the coefficients
(in the case of {math:numref}`polynom`, the numbers
$a_0, \ldots, a_N$).

Provide methods that

1.  Evaluate the polynomial {math:numref}`polynom`,
    returning $p(x)$ for any $x$.
2.  Differentiate the polynomial, replacing the original coefficients
    with those of its derivative $p'$.

Avoid using any `import` statements.

## Solutions

### Exercise 1

```{code-cell} ipython3
class ECDF:

    def __init__(self, observations):
        self.observations = observations

    def __call__(self, x):
        counter = 0.0
        for obs in self.observations:
            if obs <= x:
                counter += 1
        return counter / len(self.observations)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
