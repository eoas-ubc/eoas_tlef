## EOSC 211: Some Review plus Built-In Functions, Arrays Preview

**Name 1:**

**Name 2:**

CONCEPTS:

1.  Review variable assignment, structural elements of MATLAB

2.  Introduce the idea of arrays (from lab)

3.  Using built-in functions

1.  > **The code snippet below was intended to calculate the surface
    > area of the Earth and print the answer to the screen. What is the
    > actual output (describe the quantity in words) of the code
    > snippet?**

> **OUTPUT IS
> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

2.  > **Identify in the code snippet:**

Variable names \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Functions \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Special characters \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Operators \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

3.  > **Next to each line of the code snippet write down what the line

4.  > **What happens if I now type clear ?**

5.  > **Assume that I have the following variable,** mags**, that I have
    > defined or loaded in MATLAB**

\>\> mags

mags =

4.2000

4.1000

4.1000

4.1000

4.3000

4.2000

4.4000

4.1000

4.0000

4.7000

mags is list (array) of 10 numbers

What would I type to

a) access the magnitude in the 3<sup>rd</sup> row
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

b) define a new variable called mags2 containing the magnitude in the
last row: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

6.  > **Built-In Functions: Assume you have variable** mags **defined
    > above. What is the output to the screen of the following command?
    > Write down in words the steps involved in getting the output.**

y3 = max(mags(3:8))

**Output is:** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
