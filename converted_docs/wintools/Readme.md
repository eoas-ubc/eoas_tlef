# simple wrappers for jupyter-book and sphinx

These wrappers guarantee that jupyter-book and jupyter-sphinx run with utf8 throughout on
windowns.

**Usage**:

## windows

at a powershell prompt:

```
> runmyst .

and

> runjb .
```

## unix

for symmetry, the following will also work in macos or linux

```
> runmyst.sh .

and

> runjb.sh .
```

## Files:

- [runmyst.ps1](binwin/runmyst.ps1)

- [runjb.ps1](binwin/runmyst.ps1)

- [runmyst.sh](bin/runmyst.sh)

- [runjb.sh](bin/runjb.sh)
