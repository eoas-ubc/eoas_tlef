    "\n",
    "An IPython notebook is a web-based environment for interactive\n",

    "would using the IPython shell. In addition, you can also store and run\n",
    "programs in an IPython notebook just like you would from the Spyder\n",
    "editor window. Thus, it would seem that an IPython notebook and the\n",
    "Spyder do essentially the same thing. Up to a point, that is true. In\n",
    "the final analysis, however, Spyder (or some similar Python development\n",
    "environment) is generally more useful for developing, storing, and\n",
    "running code. An IPython Notebook, on the other hand, is excellent for\n",

    "\n",
    "If you have installed Anaconda, then you have already installed all the\n",
    "software you need to use IPython notebooks. IPython notbooks are stored\n",
    "in files with a `.ipynb` extension. To create an IPython notebook,\n",

    "the prompt `In[ ]:` to the left, appears. You can type code into this\n",
    "cell just as you would in the IPython shell of the `fig-AnacondaWindow`.\n",
    "For example, typing `2+3` into the cell and pressing `Shift-Enter` (or\n",

    "next entry. In the next cell type the commands to import `numpy` and\n",
    "`matplotlib.pyplot` as shown in the `fig-firstIPyNBcells` figure. These\n",
    "two commands are separated by the `Shift` (without `Enter` or `Return`)\n",
    "so that they appear in the same cell. They are then both executed by\n",
    "pressing `Shift-Enter` (or `Shift-Return`). After importing numpy,\n",
    "typing `sin(np.pi/6.)` and pressing `Shift-Enter` produces the expected\n",
    "result (to nearly 1 part in $10^{16}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also create plots in an IPython notebook. For example, typing\n",
    "`plt.plot([1,2,3,2,3,4,3,4,5])` and pressing `Shift-Enter` produces the\n",
    "same plot shown in the `fig-zigzagPlotDemo` figure. The plot is produced\n",
    "\"in line\" and not in a separate window, because we used the\n",
    "`--matplotlib inline` switch when we launched IPython Notebook. If you\n",

    "way means that you don't have to use the `np.` and `plt.` prefixes when\n",

    "Running programs in an IPython Notebook\n",
    "---------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also run programs in an IPython notebook. As an example, we run\n",
    "the program introduced in the section on `screenoutput`. The program is\n",
    "input into a single notebook cell and then executed by pressing\n",

    "`Enter` or `Return` key. The program then completes its execution. Thus\n",

    "Annotating an IPython Notebook\n",
    "------------------------------\n",

    "first input cell, the one that contained `2+3`. We then open the\n",
    "`Insert` menu near the top center of the window and click on\n",
    "`Insert Cell Above`, which opens up a new input cell above the first\n",
    "cell. Next, we click on the box in the Toolbar that says `Code`. A list\n",

    "`Raw Text`, `Heading 1`, `Heading 2`, ..., `Heading 6`. Select\n",
    "`Heading 1`; immediately the `In [ ]:` prompt disappears, indicating\n",
    "that this box is no longer meant for inputing and executing Python code.\n",
    "Type \"`Demo of IPython Notebook`\" and press `Shift-Enter` (or\n",
    "`Shift-Return`). A heading in large print appears before the first\n",
