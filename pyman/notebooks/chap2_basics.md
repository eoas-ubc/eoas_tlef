First Steps
===========

Installing Python on your computer
----------------------------------

If you haven't already installed Python on your computer, see `apdx1` ,
which includes instructions for installing Python on Macs running under
MacOSX and on PCs running under Windows.

single: miniconda

### Launching IPython

Once you have installed Python, open a shell and at the prompt type:

```
$ cd ~
$ mkdir testfold
$ cd testfold
```

which will make a new directory called testfold and change into it.

By typing short commands at the prompt, IPython can be used to perform
various system tasks, such as running programs and creating and moving
files around on your computer. This is a different kind of computer
interface than the icon-based interface (or "graphical user interface"
GUI) that you usually use to communicate with your computer. While it
may seem more cumbersome for some tasks, it can be more powerful for
other tasks, particularly those associated with programming.

Before getting started, we point out that like most modern computer
languages, Python is *case sensitive*. That is, Python distinguishes
between upper and lower case letters. Thus, two words spelled the same
but having different letters capitalized are treated as different names
in Python. Keep that in mind as we introduce different commands.

### Testing your installation of Python

Running the Python program below tests your installation of Python to
verify that the installation was successful. In particular, it tests
that the NumPy, SciPy, and MatPlotLib libraries that are needed for this
manual are properly installed. Now that you are in directory testfold,
start a python session with:

```
$ jupyter  qtconsole &
```

The '&' at the end 'backgrounds' the session and gives you back the bash
prompt so you can type further commands.

Launch atom from the command line with the empty file name
test\_python.py:

```
$ atom test_python.py
```
Copy these lines into test\_python.py You should input your first and
last names inside the single quotes on lines 15 and 16, respectively.
Save this file in atom.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# This code tests that your Python installation worked.
# It generates a png image file that you should e-mail 
# to the address shown on the plot
import scipy as sp
import numpy as np
import matplotlib 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import platform 
import socket

# If you are a student, please fill in your first and last
# names inside the quotes in the two lines below.  Do not
# modify anything else in this file

your_first_name = 'First' 
your_last_name = 'Last'

# If you are an instructor, modify the next 3 lines.
# You do not need to modify anything else in this file.

classname = 'ATSC 301'
term = 'Fall_2016'      # must contain no spaces
email = 'paustin@eos.ubc.ca'

plt.plot([0,1], 'r', [1,0], 'b')
plt.text( 0.5, 0.8, '{0:s} {1:s}'
        .format(your_first_name, your_last_name), 
        horizontalalignment='center',
        size = 'x-large',
        bbox=dict(facecolor='purple', alpha=0.4))
plt.text( 0.5, 0.1,
    '{1:s}\nscipy {2:s}\nnumpy {3:s}\nmatplotlib {4:s}\non {5:s}\n{6:s}'
        .format( 
        classname,
        term,
        sp.__version__, 
        np.__version__, 
        matplotlib.__version__, 
        platform.platform(), 
        socket.gethostname() 
        ) ,
    horizontalalignment='center'
    )
filename = your_last_name + '_' + your_first_name + '_' + term + '.png'
plt.title('*** E-mail the saved version of this plot, ***\n' +
    '"{0:s}" to {1:s}'.format(filename, email), fontsize=12)
plt.savefig(filename)
plt.show()
```

To run your saved file go to the IPython window and at the prompt type:

```
run test_python
```

which should produce a plot that looks something like this:

![image](attachment:screenshots/inline_plot.png)

To save this as a png file, type:

```
% matplotlib qt4
```

which switches from inline graphics to graphics that appear in a
separate window. Type:

```
run test_python
```

again to get a windowed plot

![image](attachment:screenshots/qt4_window.png)

Clicking on the floppy disk icon should prompt you for a file name to
save the figure into.

IPython Basics
--------------

### Magic Functions

pair: IPython; magic functions

IPython features a number of commands called "magic" commands that let
you perform various useful tasks. There are two types of magic commands,
line magic commands that begin with `%`---these are executed on a single
line---and cell magic commands that begin with `%%`---these are executed
on several lines. Here we will concern ourselves only with line magic
commands.

The first thing to know about magic commands is that you can toggle
(turn on and off) the need to use the `%` prefix for line magic commands
by typing `%automagic`. By default, the `Automagic` switch is set to
`ON` so you don't need the `%` prefix. To set `Automagic` to `OFF`,
simply type `%automagic` at the IPython prompt. Cell magic commands
always need the `%%` prefix.

In what follows below, we assume that the `Automagic` switch is set to
`ON` so we omit the `%` sign.

single: IPython; navigation commands

### Navigation Commands

IPython recognizes several common navigation commands that are used
under the Unix/Linux operating systems. In the IPython shell, these few
commands work on Macs, PCs, and Linux machines.

At the IPython prompt, type `cd ~` (*i.e.* "`cd`" -- "space" -- "tilde"
, where tilde is found near the upper left part of most keyboards). This
will set your computer to its home (default) directory. Next type `pwd`
(**p**rint **w**orking **d**irectory) and press RETURN. The console
should return the name of the current directory of your computer. It
might look like this on a Mac:

``` ipython
In [2]: pwd
Out[2]: u'/Users/phil'
```

or this on a PC:

``` ipython
In [3]: pwd
Out[3]: C:\\Users\\phil
```

The responses `Out[2]: u'/Users/phil'` for the Mac and
`Out[3]: C:\\Users\\phil` for the PC mean the the current directory is
`phil`, which is a subdirectory of `Users`. Taken together `/Users/phil`
on a Mac or `C:\\Users\\phil` on a PC is known as the *path* of the
current directory. The path is just the name of a directory and the
sequence of subdirectories in which it resides up to the *root*
directory.

Typing `cd ..` ("`cd`" -- "space" -- two periods) moves the IPython
shell up one directory in the directory tree, as illustrated by the set
of commands below.

``` ipython
In [4]: cd ..
/Users

In [5]: pwd
Out[5]: u'/Users'
```

The directory moved up one from `/Users/phil` to `/Users`. Now type `ls`
(**l**i**s**t) and press `RETURN`. The console should list the names of
the files and subdirectories in the current directory.

``` ipython
In [6]: ls
Shared/    phil/
```

In this case, there are only two directories (indicated by the slash)
and not files. Type `cd ~` again to return to your home directory and
then type `pwd` to verify where you are in your directory tree.
\[Technically, `ls` isn't a magic command, but typing it without the `%`
sign lists the contents of the current directory, irrespective of
whether `Automagic` is `ON` or `OFF`.\]

Let's create a directory within your documents directory that you can
use to store your Python programs. We will call it `PyProgs`. First,
return to your home directory by typing `cd ~`. To create directory
`PyProgs`, type `mkdir PyProgs` (**m**a**k**e **dir**ectory). Type `ls`
to confirm that you have created `PyProgs` and then type `cd PyProgs` to
switch to that directory.

Now let's say you want to return to the previous subdirectory,
`Documents` or `My Documents`, which should be one up in the directory
tree if you have followed along. Type `cd ..` and then type `pwd`. You
should find that you are back in the previous directory, `Documents` or
`My Documents`. If you type `ls`, you should see the new directory
`PyProgs` that you just created.

### More Magic Commands

single: IPython; magic commands

The most important magic command is `%run` *filename* where *filename*
is the name of a Python program you have created. We haven't done this
yet but include it here just for reference. We will come back to this
later.

Some other useful magic commands include `%hist`, which lists the recent
commands issued to the IPython terminal, and `%edit`, which opens a new
empty file in the code editor window. Typing `%edit` *filename*, will
open the file *filename* if it exists in the current directory, or it
will create a new file by that name if it does not, and will open it as
a blank file in the code editor window.

There are a number of other magic commands. You can get a list of them
by typing `lsmagic`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
%lsmagic
```

There are a lot of magic commands, most of which we don't need right
now. We will introduce them in the text as needed.

### System shell commands

You can also run system shell commands from the IPython shell by typing
`!` followed by a system shell command. For Macs running OSX and for
Linux machines, this means that Unix (or equivalently Linux) commands
can be issued from the IPython prompt. For PCs, this means that Windows
(DOS) commands can be issued from the IPython prompt. For example,
typing `!ls` (**l**i**s**t) and pressing RETURN lists all the files in
the current directory on a Mac. Typing `!dir` on a PC does essentially
the same thing (note that system shell commands in Windows are *not*
case sensitive).

### Tab completion

IPython also incorporates a number of shortcuts that make using the
shell more efficient. One of the most useful is **tab completion**.
Let's assume you have been following along and that your are in the
directory `Documents` or `My Documents`. To switch to the directory
`PyProgs`, you could type `cd PyProgs`. Instead of doing that, type
`cd PyP` and then press the `TAB` key. This will complete the command,
provided there is no ambiguity in how to finish the command. In the
present case, that would mean that there was no other subdirectory
beginning with `PyP`. Tab completion works with any command you type
into the IPython terminal. Try it out! It will make your life more
wonderful.

A related shortcut involves the $\uparrow$ key. If you type a command,
say `cd` and then to press the $\uparrow$ key, IPython will complete the
`cd` command with the last instance of that command. Thus, when you
launch IPython, you can use this shortcut to take you to the directory
you used when you last ran IPython.

You can also simply press the $\uparrow$ key, which will simply recall
the most recent command. Repeated application of the $\uparrow$ key
scrolls though the most recent commands in reverse order. The
$\downarrow$ key can be used to scroll in the other direction.

### Recap of commands

Let's recap the (magic) commands introduced above:

> `pwd`:  
> (**p**rint **w**orking **d**irectory) Prints the path of the current
> directory.
>
> `ls`:  
> (**l**i**s**t) Lists the names of the files and directories located in
> the current directory.
>
> `mkdir` *filename*:  
> (**m**a**k**e **dir**ectory) Makes a new directory *filename*.
>
> `cd` *directoryname*:  
> (**c**hange **d**irectory) Changes the current directory to
> *directoryname*. Note: for this to work, *directoryname* must be a
> subdirectory in the current directory. Typing `cd ~` changes to the
> home directory of your computer. Typing `cd ..` moves the console one
> directory up in the directory tree.
>
> `clear`:  
> Clears the IPython screen of previous commands.
>
> `run` *filename*:  
> Runs (executes) a Python script. Described later in the section
> `chap2:ScriptExmp1`
>
> Tab completion:  
> Provides convenient shortcuts, with or without the arrow keys, for
> executing commands in the IPython shell.

Interactive Python as a calculator
----------------------------------

You can use the IPython shell to perform simple arithmatic calculations.
For example, to find the product $3\times 15$, you type `3*15` at the
`In` prompt and press `RETURN`:

```{code-cell} ipython3
3*15
```

Python returns the correct product, as expected. You can do more
complicated calculations:

```{code-cell} ipython3
6+21/3
```

Let's try some more arithmetic:

```{code-cell} ipython3
(6+21)/3
```

Notice that the effect of the parentheses in `In [4]: (6+21)/3` is to
cause the addition to be performed first and then the division. Without
the parentheses, Python will always perform the multiplication and
division operations *before* performing the addition and subtraction
operations. The order in which arithmetic operations are performed is
the same as for most calculators: exponentiation first, then
multiplication or division, then addition or subtraction, then left to
right.

### Binary arithmetic operations in Python

The table below lists the binary arithmatic operations in Python. It has
all the standard binary operators for arithmetic, plus a few you may not
have seen before.

*Floor division*, designated by the symbols `//`, means divide and keep
only the integer part without rounding. *Remainder*, designated by the
symbols `%`, gives the remainder of after a floor division.

### Warning

#### Integer division is different in Python 2 and 3

One peculiarity of all versions of Python prior to version 3 is that
dividing two integers by each other yields the "floor division"
result---another integer. Therefore `12/7` yields `1` whereas `12./7` or
`12/7.` or `12./7.` all yield `1.714285`. Starting with version 3 of
Python, all of the above expressions, including `3/2` yield `1.714285`.
Unfortunately, we are using version 2.7 of Python so `12/7` yields `1`.
You can force versions of Python prior to version 3 to divide integers
like version 3 does by typing

```{code-cell} ipython3
from __future__ import division
```

at the beginning of an IPython session. You only need to type it once
and it works for the entire session.

### Types of numbers

There are four different types of numbers in Python: plain integers,
long integers, floating point numbers, and complex numbers.

**Plain integers**, or simply **integers**, are 32 bits (binary digits)
long, which means they extend from $-2^{31}=-2147483648$ to
$2^{31}-1=2147483647$. One bit is used to store the sign of the integer
so there are only 31 bits left---hence, the power of 31. In Python, a
number is automatically treated as an integer if is written without a
decimal point and it is within the bounds given above. This means that
`23`, written without a decimal point, is an integer and `23.`, written
with a decimal point, is a floating point number. If an integer extends
beyond the bounds of a simple integer, the it becomes a **long
integer**, and is designated as such by an `L` following the last digit.
Here are some examples of integer arithmetic:

```{code-cell} ipython3
12*3
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
4+5*6-(21*8)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
11/5
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
11//5
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
9734828*79372    # product of these two large integers is a long integer

# Note: This behaviour is not true as of Python 3, and an integer will 
# always be as large as it needs to be, as shown below -- Loren.
```

For the binary operators `+`, `-`, `*`, and `//`, the output is an
integer if the inputs are integers. The only exception is if the result
of the calculation is out of the bounds of Python integers, in which
case Python automatically converts the result to a long integer. The
output of the division operator `/` is a floating point as of version 3
of Python. If an integer output is desired when two integers are
divided, the floor division operator `//` must be used.

**Floating point** numbers are essentially rational numbers and can have
a fractional part; integers, by their very nature, have no fractional
part. In most versions of Python running on PCs or Macs, floating point
numbers go between approximately $\pm 2 \times 10^{-308}$ and
$\pm 2 \times 10^{308}$. Here are some examples of floating point
arithmetic:

```{code-cell} ipython3
12.*3.
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
123.4*(-53.9)/np.sqrt(5.)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
11./5.
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
11.//5.
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
11.%5.
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
6.022e23*300.
```

Note that the result of any operation involving only floating point
numbers as inputs is a real number, even in the cases where the floor
division `//` or remainder `%` operators are used. The last output also
illustrates an alternative way of writing floating point numbers as a
mantissa followed by and `e` or `E` followed by a power of 10: so
1.23e-12 is equivalent to $1.23 \times 10^{-12}$.

We also sneaked into our calculations `sqrt`, the square root function.
We will have more to say about functions in a few pages.

**Complex numbers** are written in Python as a sum of a real and
imaginary part. For example, the complex number $3-2i$ is represented as
`3-2j` in Python where `j` represents $\sqrt{-1}$. Here are some
examples of complex arithmetic:

```{code-cell} ipython3
(2+3j)*(-4+9j)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
(2+3j)/(-4+9j)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
np.sqrt(-3)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
np.sqrt(-3+0j)
```

Notice that to obtain the expected result or $\sqrt{-3}$, you must write
the argument of the square root function as a complex number. Otherwise,
Python returns `nan` (not a number).

If you multiply an integer by a floating point number, the result is a
floating point number. Similarly, if you multiply a floating point
number by a complex number, the result is a complex number. Python
always promotes the result to the most complex of the inputs.

+++

Python Modules
--------------

The Python computer language consists of a "core" language plus a vast
collection of supplementary software that is contained in **modules**.
Many of these modules come with the standard Python distribution and
provide added functionality for performing computer system tasks. Other
modules provide more specialized capabilities that not every user may
want. You can think of these modules as a kind of library from which you
can borrow according to your needs.

We will need three Python modules that are not part of the core Python
distribution, but are nevertheless widely used for scientific computing.
The three modules are

> NumPy  
> is the standard Python package for scientific computing with Python.
> It provides the all-important `array` data structure, which is at the
> very heart of NumPy. In also provides tools for creating and
> manipulating arrays, including indexing and sorting, as well as basic
> logical operations and element-by-element arithmetic operations like
> addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
> It includes the basic mathematical functions of trigonometry,
> exponentials, and logarithms, as well vast collection of special
> functions (Bessel functions, *etc.*), statistical functions, and
> random number generators. It also includes a large number of linear
> algebra routines that overlap with those in SciPy, although the SciPy
> routines tend to be more complete. You can find more information about
> NumPy at <http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/index.html>.
>
> SciPy  
> provides a wide spectrum of mathematical functions and numerical
> routines for Python. SciPy makes extensive use of NumPy arrays so when
> you import SciPy, you should always import NumPy too. In addition to
> providing basic mathematical functions, SciPy provides Python
> "wrappers" for numerical software written in other languages, like
> Fortran, C, or C++. A "wrapper" provides a transparent easy-to-use
> Python interface to standard numerical software, such as routines for
> doing curve fitting and numerically solving differential equations.
> SciPy greatly extends the power of Python and saves you the trouble of
> writing software in Python that someone else has already written and
> optimized in some other language. You can find more information about
> SciPy at <http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/>.
>
> MatPlotLib  
> is the standard Python package for making two and three dimensional
> plots. MatPlotLib makes extensive use of NumPy arrays. You will make
> all of your plots in Python using this package. You can find more
> information about MatPlotLib at <http://MatPlotLib.sourceforge.net/>.

We will use these three modules extensively and therefore will provide
introductions to their capabilities as we develop Python in this manual.
The links above provide much more extensive information and you will
certainly want to refer to them from time to time.

These modules, NumPy, MatPlotLib, and SciPy, are built into the IPython
shell so we can use them freely in that environment. Later, when we
introduce Python programs (or scripts), we will see that in those cases
you must explicitly load these modules using the `import` command to
have access to them.

Finally, we note that you can write your own Python modules. They are a
convenient way of packaging and storing Python code so that you can
reuse it. We defer learning about how to write modules until after we
have learned about Python.

+++

Python functions: a first look
------------------------------

A function in Python is similar to a mathematical function. In consists
of a name and one or more arguments contained inside parentheses, and it
produces some output. For example, the NumPy function `sin(x)`
calculates the sine of the number `x` (where `x` is expressed in
radians). Let's try it out in the IPython shell:

```{code-cell} ipython3
np.sin(0.5)
```

The argument of the function can be a number or any kind of expression
whose output produces a number. For example, the function `log(x)`
calculates the natural logarithm of `x`. All of the following
expressions are legal and produce the expected output:

```{code-cell} ipython3
np.log(np.sin(0.5))
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
np.log(np.sin(0.5)+1.0)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
np.log(5.5/1.2)
```

### Some NumPy functions

NumPy includes an extensive library of mathematical functions. In the
table below, we list some of the most useful ones. A much more complete
list is available at

The functions discussed here all have one input and one output. Python
functions can, in general, have multiple inputs and multiple outputs. We
will discuss these and other features of functions later when we take up
functions in the context of user-defined functions.

### Keyword arguments

In addition to regular arguments, Python functions can have keyword
arguments (`kwargs`). Keyword arguments are *optional* arguments that
need not be specified when a function is called. See
`chap5BasicPlotting` for examples of the use of keyword arguments. For
the moment, we don't need them so we defer a full discussion of keyword
arguments until we introduce them in the section on `userDefdFuncs`.

Variables
---------

### Names and the assignment operator

single: variable single: assignment operator

A variable is a name that is used to store data. It can be used to store
different kinds of data, but here we consider the simplest case where
the data is a single numerical value. Here are a few examples:

```{code-cell} ipython3
a = 23
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
p, q = 83.4, np.sqrt(2)
```

The equal sign "`=`" is the *assignment operator*. In the first
statement, it assigns the value of 23 to the variable `a`. In the second
statement it assigns a value of 83.4 to `p` and a value of
1.4142135623730951 to `q`. To be more precise, the name of a variable,
such as `a`, is associated with a *memory location* in your computer;
the assignment variable tells the computer to put a particular piece of
data, in this case a numerical value, in that memory location. Note that
Python stores the *numerical value*, not the expression used to generate
it. Thus, `q` is assigned the 17-digit number 1.4142135623730951
generated by evaluating the expression `sqrt(2)`, *not* with $\sqrt{2}$.
(Actually the value of `q` is stored as a binary, base 2, number using
scientific notation with a mantissa and an exponent.)

Suppose we write

```{code-cell} ipython3
b = a
```

In this case Python associates a new memory location with the name `b`,
distinct from the one associated with `a`, and sets the value stored at
that memory location to 23, the value of `a`. The following sequence of
statements demonstrate that fact. Can you see how? Notice that simply
typing a variable name and pressing `Return` prints out the value of the
variable.

```{code-cell} ipython3
a = 23
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
b = a
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
a
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
b
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
a = 12
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
a
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
b
```

The assignment variable works from right to left; that is, it assigns
the value of the number on the right to the variable name on the left.
Therefore, the statement "`5=a`" makes no sense in Python. The
assignment operator "`=`" in Python is not equivalent to the equals sign
"$=$" we are accustomed to in algebra.

The assignment operator can be used to increment or change the value of
a variable

```{code-cell} ipython3
b = b + 1
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
b
```

The statement, `b = b+1` makes no sense in algebra, but in Python (and
most computer languages), it makes perfect sense: it means "add 1 to the
current value of `b` and assign the result to `b`." This construction
appears so often in computer programming that there is a special set of
operators to perform such changes to a variable: `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, and
`/=`. Here are some examples of how they work:

```{code-cell} ipython3
c , d = 4, 7.92
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
c += 2
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
c
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
c *= 3
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
c
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
d /= -2
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
d
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
d -= 4
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
d
```

Verify that you understand how the above operations work.

+++

### Legal and recommended variable names

Variable names in Python must start with a letter, and can be followed
by as many alphanumeric characters as you like. Spaces are not allowed
in variable names. However, the underscore character "`_`" is allowed,
but no other character that is not a letter or a number is permitted.

Recall that Python is *case sensitive*, so the variable `a` is distinct
from the variable `A`.

We recommend giving your variables descriptive names as in the following
calculation:

```{code-cell} ipython3
distance = 34.
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
time_traveled = 0.59
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
velocity = distance / time_traveled
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
velocity
```

The variable names `distance`, `time_traveled`, and `velocity`
immediately remind you of what is being calculated here. This is good
practice. But so is keeping variable names reasonably short, so don't go
nuts!

+++

### Reserved words in Python

There are also some names or words that are reserved by Python for
special purposes or functions. You must avoid using these names, which
are provided here for your reference:

> <table style="width:81%;">
> <colgroup>
> <col style="width: 18%" />
> <col style="width: 16%" />
> <col style="width: 15%" />
> <col style="width: 15%" />
> <col style="width: 15%" />
> </colgroup>
> <tbody>
> <tr class="odd">
> <td><code>and</code></td>
> <td><code>del</code></td>
> <td><code>from</code></td>
> <td><code>not</code></td>

> <td><code>def</code></td>
> <td><code>for</code></td>
> <td><code>lambda</code></td>
> <td><code>try</code></td>
> <td></td>
> </tr>
> </tbody>
> </table>
>

In addition, you should not use function names, like `sin`, `cos`, and
`sqrt`, defined in the SciPy, NumPy, or any other library that you are
using.

+++

Script files and programs
-------------------------

Performing calculations in the IPython shell is handy if the
calculations are short. But calculations quickly become tedious when
they are more than a few lines long. If you discover you made a mistake
at some early step, for example, you may have to go back and retype all
the steps subsequent to the error. The solution to this problem is to
save your code in a file. Saving code in a file means you can just
correct the error and rerun the code without having to retype it. Saving
code can also be useful if you want to reuse it later, perhaps with
different inputs.

When we save code in a computer file, we call the sequence of commands
stored in the file a *script* or a *program* or sometimes a *routine*.
Programs can become quite sophisticated and complex. Here we are only
going to introduce the simplest features of programming by writing a
very simple script. Much later, we will introduce some of the more
advanced features of programming.

#### Tab Completion

To write a script you need a text editor. In principle, any text editor
will do, but it's more convenient to use an editor that was designed for
the task. We are going to use the **Code Editor** in the Spyder window
that appears when you launch Spyder. This editor, like most good
programming editors, provides syntax highlighting, which color codes key
words, comments, and other features of the Python syntax according to
their function, and thus makes it easier to read the code and easier to
spot programming mistakes. The Canopy code editor also provides syntax
checking, much like a spell-checker in a word processing program, that
identifies many coding errors. This can greatly speed the coding
process. Tab completion also work.

### Scripting Example 1

Let's work through an example to see how scripting works. Suppose you
are going on a road trip and you would like to estimate how long the
drive will take, how much gas you will need, and the cost of the gas.
It's a simple calculation. As inputs, you will need the distance of the
trip, your average speed, the cost of gasoline, and the mileage of your
car.

Writing a script to do these calculations is straightforward. First,
launch Spyder and open the code editor. Enter the following in the
editor pane:

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Calculates time, gallons of gas used, and cost of gasoline for
# a trip
distance = 400.         # miles
mpg = 30.               # car mileage
speed = 60.             # average speed
costPerGallon = 4.10    # price of gas

time = distance / speed
gallons = distance / mpg
cost = gallons * costPerGallon
```

The number (or hash) symbol `#` is the "comment" character in Python;
anything on a line following `#` is ignored when the code is executed.
Judicious use of comments in your code will make your code much easier
to understand days, weeks, or months after the time you wrote it. Use
comments generously.

Python ignores blank spaces or "white space" as it is sometimes called.
The statement `costPerGallon = 4.10` in the above program could equally
well be written as `costPerGallon=4.10` without the spaces before and
after the `=` assignment operator; either way the statement means the
same thing. Similarly, the white space after `costPerGallon = 4.10` but
before the comment (hash) symbol is also ignored by Python. The idea is
that you should use white space to make your program more readable.

Now you are ready to run the code.

``` ipython
In [1]: cd ~/Documents/PyProgs/
```

To *run* or *execute* a script, simply type `run` *filename*, which in
this case means type `run myTrip.py`. When you run a script, Python
simply executes the sequence of commands in the order they appear.

``` ipython
In [2]: run myTrip.py
```

Once you have run the script, you can see the values of the variables
calculated in the script simply by typing the name of the variable.
IPython responds with the value of that variable.

``` ipython
In [3]: time
Out[3]: 6.666666666666667

In [4]: gallons
Out[4]: 13.333333333333334

In [5]: cost
Out[5]: 54.666666666666664
```

You can change the number of digits IPython displays using the command
`%precision`:

``` ipython
In [6]: %precision 2
Out[6]: u'%.2f'

In [7]: time
Out[7]: 6.67

In [8]: gallons
Out[8]: 13.33

In [9]: cost
Out[9]: 54.67
```

Typing `%precision` returns IPython to its default state;
`%precision %e` causes IPython to display numbers in exponential format
(scientific notation).

#### Note about printing

If you want your script to return the value of a variable (that is,
print the value of the variable to your computer screen), use the
`print` function. For example, at the end of our script, if we include
the code

``` python
print(time)
print(gallons)
print(cost)
```

the script will return the values of the variables `time`, `gallons`,
and `cost` that the script calculated. We will discuss the `print`
function in much greater detail, as well as other methods for data
output, in Chapter 4 on `chap4`.

+++

### Scripting Example 2

Let's try another problem. Suppose you want to find the distance between
two Cartesian coordinates $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$. The
distance is given by the formula

$$\Delta r = \sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2+(z_2-z_1)^2}$$

Now let's write a script to do this calculation and save it in a file
called `twoPointDistance.py`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Calculates the distance between two 3d Cartesian coordinates
import numpy as np

x1, y1, z1 = 23.7, -9.2, -7.8
x2, y2, z2 = -3.5, 4.8, 8.1

dr = np.sqrt( (x2-x1)**2 + (y2-y1)**2 + (z2-z1)**2 )
```

We have introduced extra spaces into some of the expressions to improve
readability. They are not necessary; where and whether you include them
is largely a matter of taste.

There are two important differences between the code above and the
commands we would have written into the IPython console to execute the
same set of commands. The first is the statement on the second line

+++

``` python
...
import numpy as np
...
```

+++

and the second is the "`np.`" in front of the `sqrt` function on the
last line. If you leave out the `import numpy as np` line and remove the
`np.` in front of the `sqrt` function, you will get the following error
message

```{code-cell} ipython3
dr = sqrt( (x2-x1)**2 + (y2-y1)**2 + (z2-z1)**2 )
```

The reason for the error is that the `sqrt` function is not a part of
core Python. But it is a part of the NumPy module discussed earlier. To
make the NumPy library available to the script, you need to add the
statement `import numpy as np`. Then, when you call a NumPy function,
you need to write the function with the `np.` prefix. Failure to do
either will result in a error message. Now we can run the script.

``` ipython
In [10]: run twoPointDistance.py
In [11]: dr
Out[11]: 34.48
```

The script works as expected.

The reason we do not have to import NumPy when working in the IPython
shell is that it is done automatically when the IPython shell is
launched. Similarly, the package MatPlotLib is also automatically loaded
(imported) when IPython is launched. However, when a script or program
is executed, it is run on its own outside the IPython shell, even if the
command to run the script is executed from the IPython shell.

+++

#### Line continuation

From time to time, a line of code in a script will be unusually long,
which can make the code difficult to read. In such cases, it is
advisable to split the code onto several lines. For example, line 7 in
the preceding script could be written as

```{code-cell} ipython3
dr = np.sqrt( (x2-x1)**2 
            + (y2-y1)**2 
            + (z2-z1)**2 )
```

You can generally continue an expression on another line in Python for
code that is within a function argument, as it is here where the line is
split inside the argument of the square root function. Note that the
sub-expressions written on different lines are lined up. This is done
solely to improve readability; Python does not require it. Nevertheless,
as the whole point of splitting a line is to improve readability, it's
best to line up expressions so as to maximize readability.

You can split any Python line inside of parentheses, brackets, and
braces, as illustrated above. You can split it other places as well by
using the backslash (`\`) character. For example, the code

```{code-cell} ipython3
a = 1 + 2 \
  + 3 + 4
```

is equivalent to

```{code-cell} ipython3
a = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
```

So you can use backslash character (`\`) of explicit line continuation
when implicit line continuation won't work.

+++

Importing Modules
-----------------

single: module; importing

We saw in Example 2 in the last section that we needed to import the
NumPy module in order to use the `sqrt` function. Indeed the NumPy
library contains many useful functions, some of which are listed in
section `chap2:NumPyFuncs`. Whenever any NumPy functions are used, the
NumPy library must be loaded using an `import` statement.

There are a few ways to do this. The one we generally recommend is to
use the `import as` implementation that we used in Example 2. For the
main NumPy and MatPlotLib libraries, this is implemented as follows:

``` python
import numpy as np
import maplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

These statements import the entire library named in the `import`
statement and associate a prefix with the imported library: `np` and
`plt` in the above examples. Functions from within these libraries are
then called by attaching the appropriate prefix with a period *before*
the function name. Thus, the functions `sqrt` or `sin` from the NumPy
library are called using the syntax `np.sqrt` or `np.sin`; the functions
`plot` or `xlabel` from the `maplotlib.pyplot` would be called using
`plt.plot` or `plt.xlabel`.

Alternatively, the NumPy and MatPlotLib libraries can be called simply
by writing

``` python
import numpy
import maplotlib.pyplot
```

When loaded this way, the `sqrt` function would be called as
`numpy.sqrt` and the `plot` function would be called as
`MatPlotLib.pyplot.plot`. The `import as` syntax allows you to define
nicknames for `numpy` and `maplotlib.pyplot`. Nearly any nickname can be
chosen, but the Python community has settled on the nicknames `np` and
`plt` for `numpy` and `maplotlib.pyplot`, so you are advised to stick
with those. Using the standard nicknames makes your code more readable.

You can also import a single functions or subset of functions from a
module without importing the entire module. For example, suppose you
wanted to import just the natural log function `log` from NumPy. You
could write

``` python
from numpy import log
```

To use the `log` function in a script, you would write

``` python
a = log(5)
```

which would assign the value `1.6094379124341003` to the variable `a`.
If you wanted to import the three functions, `log`, `sin`, and `cos`,
you would write

``` python
from numpy import log, sin, cos
```

and would similarly use them without an "`np.`" prefix. In general, we
do not recommend using the the `from` *module* `import ...` way of
importing functions. When reading code, it makes it harder to determine
from which modules functions are imported, and can lead to clashes
between similarly named functions from different modules. Nevertheless,
you will see the form used in programs you encounter on the web and
elsewhere so it is important to understand the syntax.

+++

Getting help: documentation in IPython shell
--------------------------------------------

Help is never far away when you are running the IPython shell. To obtain
information on any valid Python or NumPy function, and many MatPlotLib
functions, simply type `help(` *function* `)`, as illustrated here

```{code-cell} ipython3
help(range)
```

Often, the information provided can be quite extensive and you might
find it useful to clear the IPython window with the `clear` command so
you can easily scroll back to find the beginning of the documentation.
You may have also noticed that when you type the name of a function plus
the opening parenthesis, IPython displays a window showing the first
dozen lines or so of the documentation on that function.

+++

Programming is a detail-oriented activity
-----------------------------------------

Now that you have a little experience with Python and computer
programming, it's time for an important reminder: *Programming is a
detail-oriented activity*. To be good at computer programming, to avoid
frustration when programming, you must pay attention to details. A
misplaced or forgotten comma or colon can keep your code from working.
Note that I did not say it can "keep your code from working *well*"; it
can keep your code from working at all! Worse still, little errors can
make your code give erroneous answers, where your code appears to work,
but in fact does not! So pay attention to the details!

This raises a second point: sometimes your code will run but give the
wrong answer because of a programming error or because of a more subtle
error in your algorithm. For this reason, it is important to test your
code to make sure it is behaving properly. Test it to make sure it gives
the correct answers for cases where you already know the correct answer
or where you have some independent means of checking it. Test it in
limiting cases, that is, for cases that are at the extremes of the sets
of parameters you will employ. Always test your code; this is a cardinal
rule of programming.

Exercises
---------

1.  A ball is thrown vertically up in the air from a height $h_0$ above
    the ground at an initial velocity $v_0$. Its subsequent height $h$
    and velocity $v$ are given by the equations
    
> $\begin{aligned}
    h &= h_0 + v_0t - \tfrac{1}{2}gt^2 \\
    v &= v_0 - gt
\end{aligned}$

where $g = 9.8$ is the acceleration due to gravity in $\mathrm{m/s^2}$. Write a script that finds the height $h$ and velocity $v$ at a time $t$ after the ball is thrown. Start the script by setting $h_0 = 1.2$ (meters) and $v_0 = 5.4$ (m/s) and have your script print out the values of height and velocity (see `printNote`). Then use the script to find the height and velocity after 0.5 seconds. Then modify your script to find them after 2.0 seconds.

+++

2.  Write a script that defines the variables $V_0 = 10$, $a = 2.5$, and
    $z = 4\tfrac{1}{3}$, and then evaluates the expression
    
> $V = V_0 \left( 1 - \frac{z}{\sqrt{a^2+z^2}} \right) \;.$

Then find $V$ for $z=8\frac{2}{3}$ and print it out (see `printNote`). Then find $V$ for $z=13$ by changing the value of $z$ in your script.

+++

3.  Write a single Python script that calculates the following
    expressions:
    
> $\begin{aligned}
    \text{1. } \displaystyle a &= \frac{2 + e^{2.8}}{\sqrt{13}-2} \\
    \text{2. } \displaystyle b &= \frac{1-(1+\ln 2)^{-3.5}}{1+\sqrt{5}} \\
    \text{3. } \displaystyle c &= \sin\left( \frac{2-\sqrt{2}}{2+\sqrt{2}} \right)
\end{aligned}$

 After running your script in the IPython shell, typing `a`, `b`, or `c` at the IPython prompt should yield the value of the expressions in (a), (b), or (c), respectively.

+++

4.  A quadratic equation with the general form

> $ax^2+bx+c=0$

has two solutions given by the quadratic formula

> $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} \;.$

4.1.  Given $a$, $b$, and $c$ as inputs, write a script that gives the numerical values of the two solutions. Write the constants $a$, $b$, and $c$ as floats, and show that your script gives the correct solutions for a few test cases when the solutions are real numbers, that is, when the discriminant $b^2-4ac \ge 0$. Use the `print` function in your script, discussed at the end of Section 2.8.1 `chap2:ScriptExmp1`, to print out your two solutions.

4.2. Written this way, however, your script gives an error message when the solutions are complex. For example, see what happens when $a=1$, $b=2$, and $c=3$. You can fix this using statements in your script like `a = a+0j` after setting `a` to some float value. Thus, you can make the script work for any set of real inputs for $a$, $b$, and $c$. Again, use the `print` function to print out your two solutions.
