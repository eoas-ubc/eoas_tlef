Getting started
===============

We are going to be writing our own programs, which means we need some
way to run code that takes in data and produces some kind of output. To
keep things simple, most of our code will be run as text files from a
command line. Being able to create, rename, delete and change files from
the command line is the first skill to master.

The bash command shell
----------------------

Here is first part of a tutorial that introduces the bash shell and what
it is used for: <http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/01-intro/>

### 1. Installing the bash shell

-   Macs

    There are dozens of different flavors of shell. One of these is the
    bash shell; if you have a Mac, then you already have a bash shell,
    which you can launch from spotlight by typing âŒ˜-space (i.e. press
    the "command" key together with the a space, then type the word
    "terminal" into the spotlight search bar).

-   For windows, the situation is more complicated. The default windows
    shell, which you launch by hitting the windows key

    ![image](attachment:screenshots/windows_key.jpeg)

    and typing "cmd" in the launch window, has a different syntax and is
    less capable than bash. I don't want to have to deal with two
    shells, so windows users will need to download and install a version
    of the bash shell called for windows called MSYS2 from
    <https://msys2.github.io/>

    Once you've installed it (I'm assuming in the default location
    c:msys64, type MSYS in the search bar to get the command to click
    and launch a bash shell:

    ![image](attachment:screenshots/msys_folders.png)

### 2. Working with the shell

-   Once you have a shell open, spend 30 minutes to go over
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/02-filedir> (navigating
    files and directories),
    <http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/03-create/> (working with
    files and directories) and
    ttps://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-extras/08-environment-variables.html
    (shell variables). Note that directory is just another (older) name
    for folder.

    -   The commands we will be using frequently are:

            pwd     -- print working directory
            cd a    -- change to directory a 
            cd ~    -- change to your home directory
            cd ..   -- change to the directory above
            ls      -- list files
            ls *py  -- list files ending with py
            mkdir   -- make a directory
            rm      -- remove a file
            rm -r   -- remove a directory and all subdirectories
            head    -- prints the first 5 lines of a file

    These commands will come in handy when we start writing multiple
    python scripts in different directories.

Installing the atom file editor
-------------------------------

-   We need to be able to edit configuration files and enter commands to
    be run in python. We'll start with a simple standalone editor called
    atom: <https://atom.io> which you should download and install.

-   If atom has installed correctly you should be able to open a new
    bash shell, change to your home directory (for example
    /c/users/charles) and open up an empty file called hello\_world.py,
    by typing:

        > cd ~   #to change to your home directory -- i.e. /Users/charles (mac) or /home/charles (windows)
        > atom hello_world.py

-   Type the following line into the atom hello\_world.py window:

        print('hello world')

    and save the file as \~/hello\_world.py.

Installing python
-----------------

-   We will be using a custom python distribution called miniconda. (See
    [this link](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/install/quick.html) for
    more on Anaconda and miniconda).

    Download python version 3.5 from
    <http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html> and run the installer. It
    will prompt you for a folder to install into.

    I recommend that you choose:

        c:\Users\username\mini35

    on windows and:

        /Users/username/mini35

    where username is, in my case, charles

-   I recommend accepting miniconda python as your official python, but
    if you don't want to do that we can work around it later.

    ![image](attachment:screenshots/accept_anaconda.png)

-   If the python installation is working, then open a msys2 shell and
    try the following, which on windows should give something like this:

        charles@railwin MSYS ~
        $ pwd
        /home/charles

        charles@railwin MSYS ~
        $ ls hello_world.py
        hello_world.py

        charles@railwin MSYS ~
        $ python hello_world.py
        hello world

Installing python modules
-------------------------

-   The mini in Miniconda refers to the fact that installing it gives
    you only the bare minimum needed to get things done with python. For
    our course, we will need additional packages. The package list for
    the start of the course is at
    <http://clouds.eos.ubc.ca/~phil/courses/atsc301/downloads/a301_module_list.txt>
    Save this as a text file (for example in chrome pull down File -\>
    save as) to a directory whose location you know, like
    /c/Users/phil/Downloads (on windows). Then from a bash shell, type
    the following command to download and install all of these packages:

        conda install --file /c/Users/phil/Downloads/a301_module_list.txt

Running Python
--------------

As noted in [How to run python
code](./whirlwind/01-How-to-Run-Python-Code.html), we will be using
three different methods to run python programs in the course. In
addition to running a file from the command line as above with "python
hello\_world.py" there are two more interactive approaches:

1.  ipython

    Start the ipython interpreter in the shell:

        $ ipython

    At the prompt, type:

        print('hello world')

    Or you can run the script as a file. At the prompt, type:

        run hello_world.py

    and it should print "hello world".

2.  jupyter notebook

    The [Whirlwind book](./whirlwind) is written as a series of [jupyter
    notebooks](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Notebook/Running%20Code.ipynb).
    To run individual chapters as notebooks:

    1.  Start a bash shell

    2.  make a directory to hold the chapters and cd into it:

            $ cd ~
            $ mkdir whirlwind
            $ cd whirlwind

    3.  Download a zip file containing the notebooks by clicking on
        [this
        link](http://clouds.eos.ubc.ca/~phil/courses/atsc301/downloads/WhirlwindTourOfPython-notebooks.zip)

    4.  move the zip file into the whirlwind folder. For a stock windows
        install, if you type:

            $ pwd

        and your present working directory is /home/charles/whirlwind,
        then on windows that directory would be
        c:msys64homecharleswhirlwind and on macs
        /Users/charles/whirlwind

        ![image](attachment:screenshots/expand_zip.png)

    > if this worked then doing an ls in the shell should show you the
    > expanded folder:
    >
    >     $ ls
    >     WhirlwindTourOfPython-master

    1.  start the jupyter notebook server in the whirlwind directory:

            $ jupyter notebook

        this should open your default browser and show a single folder
        "WhirlwindTourOfPython-master". Click on this to list the
        notebooks in that folder:

        ![image](attachment:screenshots/jupyter_launch.png)

    2.  Click on 02-Basic-Python-Syntax.ipynb to launch a notebook
        session for that notebook
